	<b><h4>Women's Day:</h4></b>
	<p>
	On 9 August 2020, we will celebrate National Women’s Day in South Africa with Monday 10 August 2020 declared as a public holiday.  The month of August is also National Women’s Month, which is an opportunity to celebrate women’s achievements and the important role they play in society.

	We at Stanger Manor Secondary School would like to take this opportunity to wish all women a Happy Women’s Day.  We are committed to celebrate the role played by women in our society and we aim to instil in our school community mutual respect for both men and women.

	Enjoy your day and stay safe!

	<b><h4>40 Year Anniversary!</h4></b>
	<p>
	We had ideas on how we would have liked to commemorate such a momentous event, but our plans have been put on hold for a safer time.
	We will then mark the occasion with the necessary fanfare it deserves. 
	In the meantime, we pray and hope for our school to continue growing from strength to strength.
	We are proud of all our past achievements in the form of producing excellent academic results and helping our children attain excellence in their chosen areas of expertise.  We are indeed indebted to a committed band of fearless educators who strive to take Stanger Manor Secondary school to greater heights with each passing year.   We are also deeply grateful for the tireless work being put in by the School Governing Body and the parents and learners of SMSS. 
	Congratulations, on our 40th!
